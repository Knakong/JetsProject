### Jets Program

## Description
- This is application was built as the week 3 weekend project for Skill Distillery's Full Stack Software Development with Java.
- The JetApplication first reads from a .csv file and instantiate sub class objects extending for the Jet class. There are multiple subclass of Jets(Cargo, Fighter, SimpleJet) with a few variation of interfaces include Jammer, Combat Ready, and Spy. All Jets have a fly(); method but  Jet subclasses will have other methods unique to their class. The user can add a SimpleJet, remove any Jet, find the Jet with the most range and the fastest Jet, and call some methods.

- The creation of this application goal was to gain a deeper understanding of abstract classes and working with multiple classes that share a superclass and implement different interfaces.

- This program aims to take advantage of properties a class to call its' subclass methods and with use of the operator instanceof to aid in dry coding.

## Lessons Learned

- Command over Collections and sorting them will help me the future. When working with multiple classes I'm still unsure where to put my method. It seemed to work but maybe there's a more efficient way.
